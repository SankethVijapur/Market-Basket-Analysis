# Instacart Consumer Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Instacart Consumer Behavior Analysis project! This initiative aims to empower Instacart sellers with data-driven insights into consumer actions, enabling them to anticipate future buying trends, optimize product bundles, and enhance overall inventory management. By implementing Market Basket Analysis algorithms, we delve into customer transactions to uncover valuable patterns that can revolutionize seller strategies.

## Objectives

1. **Explore Client Understanding:** Investigate methods used in previous market research to gain a comprehensive understanding of clients.

2. **Methodology Assessment:** Evaluate existing market basket analysis methodologies and apply them to our dataset to gauge their effectiveness and dimension.

3. **Outcome Evaluation:** Determine the effectiveness of various market basket analysis algorithms by evaluating their outcomes.

4. **Algorithm Selection:** Based on performance, identify the most effective market basket analysis algorithm for Instacart sellers.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Apriori:** Classic association rule algorithm.
- **FP-Growth:** Frequent Pattern Growth algorithm.
- **Eclat:** Equivalence Class Transformation algorithm.

## Usage

Explore the detailed Jupyter notebooks for each algorithm, along with the dataset and comprehensive results. Gain insights into consumer behavior and discover suggested product combinations that can enhance the overall shopping experience.

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks to dive into the analysis and results.

## Results and Insights

Check out the results of each algorithm in the respective notebooks to uncover valuable insights into consumer behavior. Understand which products are often purchased together and use this information to optimize marketing and inventory strategies.

## Contribution

We encourage collaboration! Feel free to contribute by opening issues, providing feedback, or suggesting improvements. Let's work together to refine our understanding of consumer behavior on Instacart.
